Guided tour of area using push notification / gps as tour guide


Problems to solve:
-signal
-battery life
-scared to take out phone - Could give it a VERY simple gui, or even a gimicky "cab wistle" and it just orders a taxi to your current location
- Getting some push/text messaging stuff in there (maybe on the host taxi driver company side)
