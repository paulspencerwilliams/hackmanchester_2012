Guided tour of area using push notification / gps as tour guide


Problems to solve:
- Signal
- Battery life
- Scared to take out phone 
 - Could give it a VERY simple gui
 - or even a gimicky "cab wistle" and it just orders a taxi to your current location
 - vibrates
- Getting some push/text messaging stuff in there (maybe on the host taxi driver company side)
